# Challenge-Portfolio

For this challenge I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work.
I used some of the tools what I have learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch.

Site is divided into several sections, including About Me, Work and Contact Info.

I included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections

I included a recent photo of myself.

The project presented in the My Work section include a sample program I have worked on for the bootcamp homework . And as I complete more applications in the bootcamp and on my own.

The non-placholder applications will take the user to the deployed application on my GitHub when clicked on.

The page was styled for multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.

I also included some on hover effects for the various links and the projects on the page.
